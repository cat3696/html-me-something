	<h1> <strong> ShutterFest 2018: My First Modeling Experience</strong></h1>
	<p class = "text">ShutterFest is a large photography conference that takes place in St. Louis, Missouri every year. 
	Thousands of photographers from all over the country go to Union Station hotel in order to perfect their craft. Annually, a group of photographers are hand-selected to teach classes according to what they specialize in or what they are known for in the photography world. A group of models are also selected to be subjects for those who attend the classes, as well as those who want to schedule independent shoots outside of class hours. In return for their service the models get free hair and makeup, free images to use for their professional portfolios, and access to some of the most dedicated photographers in the country to network with. Here I will be remembering my first experience as a selected ShutterFest model. </p>

		<h2>Union Station Hotel</h2>
		<p class = "text"> ShutterFest is held at the Union Station Hotel in St. Louis, Missouri. Union Station Hotel is a member of Historic Hotels of America and is also an approved Four Diamond hotel. Beautiful architecture, delicious food, and a rich history are just some of the appealing aspects of Union Station. Staying here was an absolute treat and I can see why so many photographers flock to set up shoots at this establishment. </p>

		<h2>Working With New Photographers</h2>
		<img src = "images\AndyStrong5.jpg " alt ="Photographer: Andy Strong"> 
		<p class = "text">Prior to ShutterFest, I had only worked with around four local photographers. I was very new and relatively unknown in the St. Louis modeling sphere. In the days leading up to ShutterFest, I had several photographers contact me about setting up independent shoots through the official Facebook group. Once I was there, however, I soon found that it wasn't uncommon for someone to like your "look" and set appointments with you in passing. Over a four-day period I had been photographed by at least 300 people! My experience was overwhelming and highly educational. It was as if I had gone through a modeling bootcamp of sorts. I learned that different people prefer different posting styles and that different posing styles were univerally expected depending on the "catagory" of the shoot. If shooting boudoir, many photographers expected "s" shapes and arched backs. Women tended to appreciat a more demure approach and men prefered direct eye contact with the camera. If shooting senior portraits, very basic and natural stances are best. With avant-garde shoots, however, the more artistic and unique the pose the better. As I learned how to read what the photographer wanted and expected, I was able to create happier clients. Luckily, I was able to form lasting connections that led to paid shoots and long-term working relationships.  </p>

		<h2> Working With Other Models</h2>
		<img src = "images\SarahClements.jpg" alt ="Girl posing with boy."> 
		<p class = "text">It can be challenging posing by oneself, let alone another person! You have to both direct your gazes strategically, create parallell lines and triangular shapes with your bodies, mirror moods, and come up with a new pose every few seconds. Wash, rinse, and repeat for an hour or more. Do not forget to avoid your unflattering angles and little to no verbal communication is preferable. Luckily I was able to be coached by the model above, Tyler Davis. We had both been selected for Sarah Clements' class "The Power of Androgyny."  A seasoned pro, he was able to gently guide me through the poses with ease. I gradually learned how to move slowly enough to permit mutual observation but think quickly enough to contribute new ideas. Once we were in a flow state, I felt that the experience was very similar to being in a theatrical production. We were actors reacting to one another and telling a story. Instead of applause we were greeted with faster shutter-clicks and quiet cooing from the photographers. It was from this experience that I started appreciating collaboration while modeling and was happy to take part in the other couple/group shoots that came later in the conference. </p>

		<h2> My First Paid Gig At Sk8 Liborius</h2>
		<img src = "images\lensbaby.jpg" alt ="Girl wearing beanie."> 
		<p class = "text">The picture above is a relic of my first paid photoshoot. I had been scouted by some employees of LensBaby because of my short hair. They asked me to play the part of a "skater-chick" and I was more than happy to oblige! This shoot took place at Sk8 Liborius in St. Louis, which is an old cathedral turned skatepark! It was amazing to see skateboarders who were way more coordinated and skilled than I could ever hope to be. If you like to skateboard, I highly reccomend checking it out!</p>

		<h2> My First Publication</h2>
		<p class = "text">Above is the page of a magazine that I was published in with the talented Tyler Davis. I actually had no idea that the image was even submitted for publication and found out a few weeks later. Talk about a good morning! My parents were definitely proud of me that day. </p>

		<h2> Lifelong Memories</h2>
		<p class = "text"> At the time of this conference, I had just started modeling. The only professional photos I had taken of me were for school and I had never been too confident in my appearance. This experience not only allowed me to interact with hundreds of talented people, it also allowed me to explore new aspects of my identity. For years I had falsely believed that modeling took little skill or thought. That if I placed value in aesthetic pursuits I was making some grave moral error. Starting my modeling journey at this conference was a much-needed reality check. I learned that in order to make a good photo, you have to understand how light behaves with different surfaces. How to use psychology and geometry to make an appealing image in the few seconds it takes for a photographer to press a shutter-button and tell you "next." I can appreciate academics AND putting my makeup on. It is alright for me to appreciate the complexities of a world that many people believe is superficial and simplistic.   </p>
